# TODO: Fix Terminal Output Issues

## Issues Identified
1. **Prisma Connection Error (P1001)**: Database server unreachable at localhost:5432. Need to start PostgreSQL and verify DATABASE_URL.
2. **Runtime Error: "decision is not defined"**: In `actions/dashboard.js`, `decision` is referenced but not defined (ArcJet code commented out).
3. **Runtime Error: "router is not defined"**: In `components/create-account-drawer.jsx`, `router` used without import.
4. **404 Errors**: Routes `/account` and `/transactions` returning 404. Check if pages exist or routing is correct.

## Tasks
- [x] Fix `decision` error in `actions/dashboard.js` by removing the unused `if (decision.isDenied())` block.
- [x] Fix `router` error in `components/create-account-drawer.jsx` by importing `useRouter` from `next/navigation`.
- [ ] Resolve Prisma connection: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and DATABASE_URL is set.
- [ ] Investigate 404 errors: Verify routes exist (e.g., `/account/[id]` exists, but `/account` might need a static page).
- [ ] Test the fixes by running the app and checking for errors.
